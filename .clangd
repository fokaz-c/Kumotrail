# .clangd configuration file for the KumoTrail project.
#
# This file tells the clangd language server how to compile the source code,
# enabling features like autocompletion, error checking, and go-to-definition
# in your code editor (e.g., VS Code, Vim, Emacs).

CompileFlags:
  # Add all the compiler flags from the Makefile here.
  # These flags ensure that clangd understands the target architecture,
  # include paths, and bare-metal environment.
  Add:
    # CRITICAL: Tell clangd the target architecture to prevent errors.
