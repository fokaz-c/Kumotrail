/**
 * @file boot.S
 * @brief KumoTrail koro kernel bootstrap assembly for ESP32-C3 RISC-V processor
 *
 * This assembly module implements the critical system initialization sequence
 * that executes immediately after hardware reset. The bootstrap code establishes
 * the minimal runtime environment required for C code execution, including
 * stack initialization, memory clearing, and control transfer to the kernel.
 *
 * Execution Context:
 * - Runs in machine mode with full hardware access
 * - No prior C runtime or stack configuration exists
 * - All registers contain undefined values after reset
 * - Memory sections require initialization per C language standards
 *
 * @version 1.0
 * @date 2025
 * @author Fokaz
 *
 * @changelog
 * Version 1.0 - 23-08-2025 - Fokaz
 *   - Initial ESP32-C3 bootstrap implementation
 *   - RISC-V stack and BSS initialization
 *   - Integration with KumoTrail linker script symbols

/*
 * Global Symbol Declaration
 *
 * The .global directive exports the _start symbol to the linker, making it
 * visible during the linking process. The linker script references this symbol
 * in its ENTRY() declaration to specify the program's execution entry point.
 *
 * Linker Integration:
 * The symbol _start must match exactly with the ENTRY(_start) declaration
 * in the corresponding linker script to ensure proper program initialization.

/**
 * Program Entry Point: System Bootstrap Sequence
 *
 * The _start label marks the first instruction executed after processor reset.
 * This entry point is responsible for transitioning from the undefined post-reset
 * hardware state to a stable C runtime environment suitable for kernel execution.
 *
 * Bootstrap Sequence Overview:
 * 1. Initialize stack pointer for function call support
 * 2. Clear BSS section to satisfy C language requirements
 * 3. Transfer control to main kernel initialization function
 * 4. Handle unexpected return conditions with infinite loop

     * Stack Pointer Initialization
     * ============================
     *
     * The ESP32-C3 RISC-V implementation requires a properly configured stack
     * before any function calls can be executed. The stack provides storage for:
     * - Function call return addresses
     * - Local variable allocation
     * - Function parameter passing (beyond register capacity)
     * - Interrupt and exception frame preservation
     *
     * Stack Architecture:
     * - Growth Direction: Downward (high to low addresses)
     * - Alignment: 8-byte boundary per RISC-V ABI specification
     * - Initial Location: Highest available RAM address (__stack_top)
     *
     * The __stack_top symbol is generated by the linker script and points to
     * the first address beyond the end of available RAM, providing maximum
     * stack space while avoiding collision with other memory sections.

    /*
     * BSS Section Zero-Initialization
     * ===============================
     *
     * The C language standard (ISO/IEC 9899) mandates that all uninitialized
     * and zero-initialized global and static variables must contain zero values
     * before program execution begins. The BSS (Block Started by Symbol) section
     * contains these variables but occupies no space in the executable file.
     *
     * BSS Section Characteristics:
     * - Contains uninitialized global variables: int counter;
     * - Contains zero-initialized variables: static char buffer[1024] = {0};
     * - Contains NULL pointer initializations: void *ptr = NULL;
     * - Exists only as reserved memory addresses, not file data
     *
     * Boundary Symbol Usage:
     * The linker script generates __bss_start and __bss_end symbols that
     * define the exact memory range requiring zero-initialization.
     *
     * Register Allocation:
     * - a0: Current memory address being processed
     * - a1: End boundary address for loop termination

     * Kernel Initialization Transfer
     * ==============================
     *
     * With the C runtime environment properly established, control can be
     * safely transferred to the main kernel initialization function. At this
     * point, the following conditions are guaranteed:
     * - Stack pointer is configured for function calls
     * - BSS section contains only zero values
     * - All global variables are in their expected initial state
     *
     * The main() function represents the entry point for high-level kernel
     * initialization, including hardware peripheral configuration, interrupt
     * setup, and task scheduler initialization.
     *
     * Function Call Convention:
     * The 'call' instruction automatically saves the return address in the
     * ra register and transfers control to the main function. However, in
     * a bare-metal kernel environment, main() should never return.

    /*
     * Unexpected Return Handling
     * ==========================
     *
     * In a properly designed bare-metal kernel, the main initialization function
     * should never return control to the bootstrap code. The kernel should either:
     * - Enter an infinite scheduling loop
     * - Transfer control to the first user task
     * - Enter a low-power idle state
     *
     * If main() does return (indicating a critical kernel failure), this infinite
     * loop provides a safe fallback that prevents undefined behavior:
     * - Prevents execution of random memory contents
     * - Maintains system in a known, stable state
     * - Facilitates debugging by providing a predictable halt location
     *
     * Production Implementation Notes:
     * - Consider adding watchdog timer configuration
     * - Implement error logging before entering halt state
     * - Optionally trigger system reset for fault recovery

 * End of Bootstrap Assembly Module
 *
 * This assembly module provides the foundation for KumoTrail koro kernel execution
 * on the ESP32-C3 platform. The bootstrap sequence ensures compliance with
 * C language standards and RISC-V ABI requirements, enabling seamless
 * transition to high-level kernel implementation.
 *
 * Integration Requirements:
 * - Linker script must define __stack_top, __bss_start, __bss_end symbols
 * - main() function must be implemented in C source files
 * - Build system must assemble this file before linking
 * - Stack size must be sufficient for kernel initialization requirements
